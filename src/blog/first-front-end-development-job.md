This is an update from my post about a non-technical interview tip that led me to get my first Front-end Developer job.
<br>
<br>
If you’ve read the above linked post, you’ve learned how I prepped for an interview that led me to land my first formally employed full-time gig as a Front-end Developer. Definitely give it a read or share it with someone who might benefit from this sort of mental preparation for an interview!

<h2>My First Front-End Developer Job</h2>
<br>

It’s been a little over two weeks as an officially employed Front-end Developer at a snazzy web development agency.
<br>
<br>

So far, my work days feel like they’re going by fast, which is good. The phrase, “time flies when you’re having fun” applies here — even though I’ve been sporting my focused learning face ’round the clock.

<i>Fellow co-workers, if you’re lurking this I promise I’m not mad or grumpy. I’m just doing my best to get up-to-speed with the rest of the team!</i>
<br>
<br>

<h2>What I’ve Been Doing</h2>
<br>

My time spent so far has been reviewing the company’s repos and getting a feel for how the team structures their code.
<br>
<br>

I’ve also been getting my hands dirty with an internal project. This is a relatively stressless first go-round as I’m not dealing with any clients directly, yet.
<br>
<br>

The process of working on this internal project has been pretty straight-forward:
<br>
<br>

<li class="blog-post-li">Look at a design</li>
<li class="blog-post-li">Think about the best way to structure and style it</li>
<li class="blog-post-li">Start coding</li>
<li class="blog-post-li">Use the Read-Search-Ask method if I get stuck</li>
<li class="blog-post-li">Ask for code reviews after blocks of the design is done</li>
<li class="blog-post-li">Refactor code</li>
<li class="blog-post-li">Repeat</li>
  <br>
  <br>

Goals with this project:
<br>
<br>

<li class="blog-post-li">Learn the team’s best practices for writing code</li>
<li class="blog-post-li">Ask well-informed questions when issues arise</li>
<li class="blog-post-li">Not make a fool of myself</li>
<li class="blog-post-li">Finish the project in a timely manner</li>

<br>
<br>

It’s been a great learning experience so far — definitely levels up from the comfort of picking your own projects to work on where you have first and final say in its entirety.
<br>
<br>

<h2>Some Other Things</h2>
<br>
<br>

Aside from actual work, I’m happy to be near a beautiful park where I can stretch my legs and enjoy some vitamin D during breaks. It’s easy to sit behind the screens and stay entertained from one site to the next so being in an office where a place like this is so accessible is seriously so nice.
<br>
<br>

Anyway, that's that. Onward I go, cheers ✌🏻

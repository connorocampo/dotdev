Hereâ€™s a screencap of the message preview from my iPhone:\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>The screencap somehow got deleted, please enjoy this cat noping into a cardboard box instead</em> ðŸ™ƒ\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/b9TLVAyi8U6wE/giphy.gif\" class=\"placeholder blog-image-mobile\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>To summarize what the screencap was about, my friend on LinkedIn sent me a message congratulating and encouraging me on breaking into the tech scene as a self-taught developer. They said watching my progress and achievements inspired them to go into the field and learn on their own.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p>We chatted briefly on LinkedIn and did a little Q&#x26;A. At the end of the conversation, I left the door open for any future questions.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<h2>What This Means To Me</h2>\n<br>\n<p>I was definitely happy to learn that another person became inspired through following my journey as a self-taught front-end developer. Maybe to someone else this might seem like a simple exchange of words, but it really inspired me. I worked so hard to get here, and sometimes I'm so hard on myself thinking I'm not even any good.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p>My friends message was a reminder that I have accomplished something worth praise. That said, I want to encourage anyone reading this to take a moment and realize how far you've come. Nice work, friend.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<h2>Okay, mini-rant over ðŸ˜…</h2>\n<br>\n<p>At the end of the day, I wanted to write about my pleasant surprise. Thank you for encouraging me to keep at it. I hope you go forward in the direction that makes you happy!</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: inline-block;\n    min-width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-highlighted {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, transparent);\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, transparent);\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Self-Taught Developer and LinkedIn","date":"May 28, 2019","category":"Web Development","tags":["Front End Development","Code"]},"timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/a-self-taught-front-end-developer-and-linkedin/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/first-front-end-development-job/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My First Front-End Developer Job ðŸŽ‰"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/custom-svg-animations/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Custom SVG Animations"}}}}}

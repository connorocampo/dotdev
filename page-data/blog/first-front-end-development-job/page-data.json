Definitely give it a read or share it with someone who might benefit from this sort of mental preparation for an interview!\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<h2>My First Front-End Developer Job</h2>\n<br>\n<p>It‚Äôs been a little over two weeks as an officially employed Front-end Developer at a snazzy web development agency.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p>So far, my work days feel like they‚Äôre going by fast, which is good. The phrase, ‚Äútime flies when you‚Äôre having fun‚Äù applies here ‚Äî even though I‚Äôve been sporting my focused learning face ‚Äôround the clock.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/community.cisco.com/legacyfs/online/photo/stickmanatcomputer.png?zoom=2&amp;w=840&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"placeholder blog-image-mobile\">\n<br></p>\n<p><i>Fellow co-workers, if you‚Äôre lurking this I promise I‚Äôm not mad or grumpy. I‚Äôm just doing my best to get up-to-speed with the rest of the team!</i>\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<h2>What I‚Äôve Been Doing</h2>\n<br>\n<p>My time spent so far has been reviewing the company‚Äôs repos and getting a feel for how the team structures their code.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p>I‚Äôve also been getting my hands dirty with an internal project. This is a relatively stressless first go-round as I‚Äôm not dealing with any clients directly, yet.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p>The process of working on this internal project has been pretty straight-forward:\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Look at a design</li>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Think about the best way to structure and style it</li>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Start coding</li>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Use the Read-Search-Ask method if I get stuck</li>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Ask for code reviews after blocks of the design is done</li>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Refactor code</li>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Repeat</li>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n<p>Goals with this project:\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Learn the team‚Äôs best practices for writing code</li>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Ask well-informed questions when issues arise</li>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Not make a fool of myself</li>\n<li class=\"blog-post-li\">Finish the project in a timely manner</li>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>It‚Äôs been a great learning experience so far ‚Äî definitely levels up from the comfort of picking your own projects to work on where you have first and final say in its entirety.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<h2>Some Other Things</h2>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>Aside from actual work, I‚Äôm happy to be near a beautiful park where I can stretch my legs and enjoy some vitamin D during breaks. It‚Äôs easy to sit behind the screens and stay entertained from one site to the next so being in an office where a place like this is so accessible is seriously so nice.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p>Anyway, that's that.
